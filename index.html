            <p>A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of
                intake and is more likely to iprove health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee
                daily.Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fracture and a possible increased
                risk in pregnant women of fetal,loss or decreased birth weight.Results were complicated by poor study
                quality,and differences in age,gender,health status,and serving size.

                Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called Coffee cherry.Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a
                genus of
                plants called Coffea.There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants,ranging from shrubs to trees.

        <p><b><span>!!Coffee Beans</span></b>are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on
            coffee trees from a genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants,
            ranging from shrubs to trees.</p><br><br>
        <p><b><span>!!Type of bean.</span></b> There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica
            originates from Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type
            worldwide. However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment,
            requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee
            plant is more economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of
            temperatures between 65-97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as
            variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.</p><br><br>
        <p><b><span>!!Type of grind</b></span>. A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee
            makers. A fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, which releases the oils, and a coarse grind
            is used in coffee presses.</p><br><br>
        <p><b><span>!!Decaffeinated coffee.</b></span> This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side
            effects from caffeine. The two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee is to apply chemical
            solvents (methylene chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas. Both are applied to steamed or soaked
            beans, which are then allowed to dry. The solvents bind to caffeine and both evaporate when the beans are
            rinsed and/or dried. According to U.S. regulations, at least 97% of the caffeine must be removed to carry
            the decaffeinated label, so there may be trace residual amounts of caffeine. Both methods may cause some
            loss of flavor as other naturally occurring chemicals in coffee beans that impart their unique flavor and
            scent may be destroyed during processing.</p>

                Bill Rosenberg opened Open Kettle in 1948, a restaurant selling donuts and coffee in Quincy,
                Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston), but he changed the name in 1950 to Dunkin' Donuts after discussing
                with company executives.He conceived the idea for the restaurant after his experiences selling food in
                factories and at construction sites, where donuts and coffee were the two most popular items.
                The restaurant was successful, and Rosenberg sold franchises to others starting in 1955

                McCafé is a coffee-house-style food and beverage chain, owned by McDonald's. Conceptualised and launched
                in Melbourne, Australia, in 1993,and introduced to the public with help from McDonald's CEO Charlie Bell
                and then-chairman and future CEO James Skinner, the chain reflects a consumer trend towards espresso
                coffees.

                Reports indicated that McCafé outlets generated 15% more revenue than a regular McDonald's and, by 2003,
                were the largest coffee shop brand in Australia and New Zealand.
